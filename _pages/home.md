I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (BEEE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

My research mainly focuses on i) building energy resources and their interactions with the power grid, ii) electricity markets and new-type electric power systems, and iii) urban integrated energy systems and Energy Internet. 

I have multiple positions available for Ph.D. students in the Sept. 2026 batch. In general, applicants should have the following qualifications:

1) For the Ph.D. program without master's degrees, the applicant is expected to receive his/her bachelor's degree from a Chinese 985 or similar-level university (e.g., universities with exceptional strengths in related areas, emerging high-level universities, or renowned universities outside mainland China) with an excellent ranking;
  
2) For the Ph.D. program with master's degrees, the applicant is expected to receive his/her master's degree from a Chinese 985 or similar-level university with solid research outcomes;
   
3) If you do not satisfy the requirements above, but have a strong passion for research excellence, you are still welcome to contact me;
   
4) All applicants must satisfy all the basic requirements of the HK [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/prospective-students/how-to-apply/). Should have solid mathematical foundations and experience in one or more of the following areas (depending on research directions you want to pursue): Building energy systems, electric power systems, electricity markets, electric vehicles, renewable energy, deep learning, and large language models.

I also welcome applicants for postdocs, visiting scholars, and research assistants.

If you are interested, please send your CV and a one-page self-statement (both in English) to ye.guo(at)polyu.edu.hk. There is no requirement for the statement. You can organize whatever content you consider helpful to convince me.
